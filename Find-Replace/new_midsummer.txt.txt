ACT I. SCENE I.
Athens. The palace of THIS IMPORTANT DUDE

Enter THIS IMPORTANT DUDE, PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE, ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE, and ATTENDANTS

  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Now, fair Probably Cooler than Important Dude, our nuptial hour
    Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
    Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow
    This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
    Like to a step-dame or a dowager,
    Long withering out a young man's revenue.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
    Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
    And then the moon, like to a silver bow
    New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
    Of our solemnities.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Go, On Stage for Like a Minute,
    Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
    Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
    Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
    The pale companion is not for our pomp.     Exit ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE
    Probably Cooler than Important Dude, I woo'd thee with my sword,
    And won thy love doing thee injuries;
    But I will wed thee in another key,
    With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.

          Enter NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE, and his daughter LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG, THAT GUY,
                           and THIS GUY

  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. Happy be This Important Dude, our renowned Duke!
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Thanks, good Not So Important Dude; what's the news with thee?
  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. Full of vexation come I, with complaint
    Against my child, my daughter Lady Done Major Wrong.
    Stand forth, This Guy. My noble lord,
    This man hath my consent to marry her.
    Stand forth, That Guy. And, my gracious Duke,
    This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.
    Thou, thou, That Guy, thou hast given her rhymes,
    And interchang'd love-tokens with my child;
    Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
    With feigning voice, verses of feigning love,
    And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
    With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
    Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats- messengers
    Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth;
    With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
    Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
    To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,
    Be it so she will not here before your Grace
    Consent to marry with This Guy,
    I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
    As she is mine I may dispose of her;
    Which shall be either to this gentleman
    Or to her death, according to our law
    Immediately provided in that case.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. What say you, Lady Done Major Wrong? Be advis'd, fair maid.
    To you your father should be as a god;
    One that compos'd your beauties; yea, and one
    To whom you are but as a form in wax,
    By him imprinted, and within his power
    To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
    This Guy is a worthy gentleman.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. So is That Guy.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. In himself he is;
    But, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
    The other must be held the worthier.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
    I know not by what power I am made bold,
    Nor how it may concern my modesty
    In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
    But I beseech your Grace that I may know
    The worst that may befall me in this case,
    If I refuse to wed This Guy.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Either to die the death, or to abjure
    For ever the society of men.
    Therefore, fair Lady Done Major Wrong, question your desires,
    Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
    Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
    You can endure the livery of a nun,
    For aye to be shady cloister mew'd,
    To live a barren sister all your life,
    Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
    Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
    To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
    But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
    Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
    Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
    Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
    Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
    My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Take time to pause; and by the next new moon-
    The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
    For everlasting bond of fellowship-
    Upon that day either prepare to die
    For disobedience to your father's will,
    Or else to wed This Guy, as he would,
    Or on Diana's altar to protest
    For aye austerity and single life.
  THIS GUY. Relent, sweet Lady Done Major Wrong; and, That Guy, yield
    Thy crazed title to my certain right.
  THAT GUY. You have her father's love, This Guy;
    Let me have Lady Done Major Wrong's; do you marry him.
  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. Scornful That Guy, true, he hath my love;
    And what is mine my love shall render him;
    And she is mine; and all my right of her
    I do estate unto This Guy.
  THAT GUY. I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
    As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
    My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
    If not with vantage, as This Guy';
    And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
    I am belov'd of beauteous Lady Done Major Wrong.
    Why should not I then prosecute my right?
    This Guy, I'll avouch it to his head,
    Made love to Nedar's daughter, Also Lady Done Major Wrong,
    And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
    Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
    Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. I must confess that I have heard so much,
    And with This Guy thought to have spoke thereof;
    But, being over-full of self-affairs,
    My mind did lose it. But, This Guy, come;
    And come, Not So Important Dude; you shall go with me;
    I have some private schooling for you both.
    For you, fair Lady Done Major Wrong, look you arm yourself
    To fit your fancies to your father's will,
    Or else the law of Athens yields you up-
    Which by no means we may extenuate-
    To death, or to a vow of single life.
    Come, my Probably Cooler than Important Dude; what cheer, my love?
    This Guy, and Not So Important Dude, go along;
    I must employ you in some business
    Against our nuptial, and confer with you
    Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. With duty and desire we follow you.
                              Exeunt all but THAT GUY and LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG
  THAT GUY. How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale?
    How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Belike for want of rain, which I could well
    Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
  THAT GUY. Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
    Could ever hear by tale or history,
    The course of true love never did run smooth;
    But either it was different in blood-
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
  THAT GUY. Or else misgraffed in respect of years-
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O spite! too old to be engag'd to young.
  THAT GUY. Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
  THAT GUY. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
    War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,
    Making it momentary as a sound,
    Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
    Brief as the lightning in the collied night
    That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
    And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
    The jaws of darkness do devour it up;
    So quick bright things come to confusion.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
    It stands as an edict in destiny.
    Then let us teach our trial patience,
    Because it is a customary cross,
    As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
    Wishes and tears, poor Fancy's followers.
  THAT GUY. A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Lady Done Major Wrong.
    I have a widow aunt, a dowager
    Of great revenue, and she hath no child-
    From Athens is her house remote seven leagues-
    And she respects me as her only son.
    There, gentle Lady Done Major Wrong, may I marry thee;
    And to that place the sharp Athenian law
    Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
    Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
    And in the wood, a league without the town,
    Where I did meet thee once with Also Lady Done Major Wrong
    To do observance to a morn of May,
    There will I stay for thee.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. My good That Guy!
    I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
    By his best arrow, with the golden head,
    By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
    By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
    And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen,
    When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
    By all the vows that ever men have broke,
    In number more than ever women spoke,
    In that same place thou hast appointed me,
    To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
  THAT GUY. Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Also Lady Done Major Wrong.

                         Enter ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. God speed fair Also Lady Done Major Wrong! Whither away?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.
    This Guy loves your fair. O happy fair!
    Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue's sweet air
    More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
    When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
    Sickness is catching; O, were favour so,
    Yours would I catch, fair Lady Done Major Wrong, ere I go!
    My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
    My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
    Were the world mine, This Guy being bated,
    The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
    O, teach me how you look, and with what art
    You sway the motion of This Guy' heart!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O that my prayers could such affection move!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. The more I hate, the more he follows me.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. The more I love, the more he hateth me.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. His folly, Also Lady Done Major Wrong, is no fault of mine.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
    That Guy and myself will fly this place.
    Before the time I did That Guy see,
    Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me.
    O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
    That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
  THAT GUY. Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
    To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
    Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,
    Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
    A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
    Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. And in the wood where often you and I
    Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
    Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
    There my That Guy and myself shall meet;
    And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
    To seek new friends and stranger companies.
    Farewell, sweet playfellow; pray thou for us,
    And good luck grant thee thy This Guy!
    Keep word, That Guy; we must starve our sight
    From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
  THAT GUY. I will, my Lady Done Major Wrong. [Exit LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG] Also Lady Done Major Wrong, adieu;
    As you on him, This Guy dote on you.                   Exit
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. How happy some o'er other some can be!
    Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
    But what of that? This Guy thinks not so;
    He will not know what all but he do know.
    And as he errs, doting on Lady Done Major Wrong's eyes,
    So I, admiring of his qualities.
    Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
    Love can transpose to form and dignity.
    Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
    And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
    Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste;
    Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste;
    And therefore is Love said to be a child,
    Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
    As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
    So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere;
    For ere This Guy look'd on Lady Done Major Wrong's eyne,
    He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
    And when this hail some heat from Lady Done Major Wrong felt,
    So he dissolv'd, and show'rs of oaths did melt.
    I will go tell him of fair Lady Done Major Wrong's flight;
    Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
    Pursue her; and for this intelligence
    If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
    But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
    To have his sight thither and back again.               Exit




SCENE II.
Athens. SUPERSTAR'S house

Enter SUPERSTAR, ANOTHER SUPERSTAR, FAMOUS ACTOR DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE, NOT REALLY INTO IT, and ALONG FOR THE RIDE

  SUPERSTAR. Is all our company here?
  FAMOUS ACTOR. You were best to call them generally, man by man,
according
    to the scrip.
  SUPERSTAR. Here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought
    fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the
Duke
    and the Duchess on his wedding-day at night.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. First, good Peter Superstar, say what the play treats on;
then
    read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
  SUPERSTAR. Marry, our play is 'The most Lamentable Comedy and most
    Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby.'
  FAMOUS ACTOR. A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.
Now,
    good Peter Superstar, call forth your actors by the scroll.
Masters,
    spread yourselves.
  SUPERSTAR. Answer, as I call you. Nick Famous Actor, the weaver.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
  SUPERSTAR. You, Nick Famous Actor, are set down for Pyramus.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?
  SUPERSTAR. A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. That will ask some tears in the true performing of it.
If I
    do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move
storms; I
    will condole in some measure. To the rest- yet my chief
humour is
    for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a
cat
    in, to make all split.

                 'The raging rocks
                 And shivering shocks
                 Shall break the locks
                   Of prison gates;

                 And Phibbus' car
                 Shall shine from far,
                 And make and mar
                   The foolish Fates.'

    This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is
    Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein: a lover is more condoling.
  SUPERSTAR. Francis Don't Sleep on This One, the bellows-mender.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. Here, Peter Superstar.
  SUPERSTAR. Don't Sleep on This One, you must take Thisby on you.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?
  SUPERSTAR. It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard
coming.
  SUPERSTAR. That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you
may
    speak as small as you will.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too.
    I'll speak in a monstrous little voice: 'Thisne, Thisne!'
    [Then speaking small] 'Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy
    Thisby dear, and lady dear!'
  SUPERSTAR. No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Don't Sleep on This One, you Thisby.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Well, proceed.
  SUPERSTAR. Robin Along for the Ride, the tailor.
  ALONG FOR THE RIDE. Here, Peter Superstar.
  SUPERSTAR. Robin Along for the Ride, you must play Thisby's mother.
    Tom Not Really Into It, the tinker.
  NOT REALLY INTO IT. Here, Peter Superstar.
  SUPERSTAR. You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father; Another Superstar,
the
    joiner, you, the lion's part. And, I hope, here is a play
fitted.
  ANOTHER SUPERSTAR. Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it be,
give it
    me, for I am slow of study.
  SUPERSTAR. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do
any
    man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the
    Duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'
  SUPERSTAR. An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the
    Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were
    enough to hang us all.
  ALL. That would hang us, every mother's son.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies
out
    of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang
us;
    but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as
gently
    as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
nightingale.
  SUPERSTAR. You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
    sweet-fac'd man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's
    day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must
needs
    play Pyramus.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to
play
    it in?
  SUPERSTAR. Why, what you will.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,
your
    orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your
    French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.
  SUPERSTAR. Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
then
    you will play bare-fac'd. But, masters, here are your parts;
and
    I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them
by
    to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile
without
    the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we
meet in
    the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our devices
known.
    In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our
    play wants. I pray you, fail me not.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely
and
    courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.
  SUPERSTAR. At the Duke's oak we meet.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings.               Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE I.
A wood near Athens

Enter a FAIRY at One door, and FUNNY PERSON at another

  FUNNY PERSON. How now, spirit! whither wander you?
  FAIRY.      Over hill, over dale,
                Thorough bush, thorough brier,
              Over park, over pale,
                Thorough flood, thorough fire,
              I do wander every where,
              Swifter than the moon's sphere;
              And I serve the Fairy Queen,
              To dew her orbs upon the green.
              The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
              In their gold coats spots you see;
              Those be rubies, fairy favours,
              In those freckles live their savours.

    I must go seek some dewdrops here,
    And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
    Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone.
    Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
  FUNNY PERSON. The King doth keep his revels here to-night;
    Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;
    For Who Does This Guy Think He Is is passing fell and wrath,
    Because that she as her attendant hath
    A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
    She never had so sweet a changeling;
    And jealous Who Does This Guy Think He Is would have the child
    Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
    But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
    Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.
    And now they never meet in grove or green,
    By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
    But they do square, that all their elves for fear
    Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.
  FAIRY. Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
    Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
    Call'd Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he
    That frights the maidens of the villagery,
    Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,
    And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
    And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
    Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
    Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Funny Person,
    You do their work, and they shall have good luck.
    Are not you he?
  FUNNY PERSON. Thou speakest aright:
    I am that merry wanderer of the night.
    I jest to Who Does This Guy Think He Is, and make him smile
    When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
    Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;
    And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl
    In very likeness of a roasted crab,
    And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,
    And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
    The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
    Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
    Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
    And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
    And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
    And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
    A merrier hour was never wasted there.
    But room, fairy, here comes Who Does This Guy Think He Is.
  FAIRY. And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

       Enter WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS at one door, with his TRAIN, and LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD,
                        at another, with hers

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Ill met by moonlight, proud Lady Who Runs the World.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. What, jealous Who Does This Guy Think He Is! Fairies, skip hence;
    I have forsworn his bed and company.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Then I must be thy lady; but I know
    When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
    And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
    Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
    To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
    Come from the farthest steep of India,
    But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
    Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
    To This Important Dude must be wedded, and you come
    To give their bed joy and prosperity?
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. How canst thou thus, for shame, Lady Who Runs the World,
    Glance at my credit with Probably Cooler than Important Dude,
    Knowing I know thy love to This Important Dude?
    Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
    From Perigouna, whom he ravished?
    And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,
    With Ariadne and Antiopa?
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. These are the forgeries of jealousy;
    And never, since the middle summer's spring,
    Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
    By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,
    Or in the beached margent of the sea,
    To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
    But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
    Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
    As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
    Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
    Hath every pelting river made so proud
    That they have overborne their continents.
    The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
    The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
    Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
    The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
    And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
    The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
    And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
    For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.
    The human mortals want their winter here;
    No night is now with hymn or carol blest;
    Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
    Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
    That rheumatic diseases do abound.
    And thorough this distemperature we see
    The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
    Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;
    And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
    An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
    Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,
    The childing autumn, angry winter, change
    Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,
    By their increase, now knows not which is which.
    And this same progeny of evils comes
    From our debate, from our dissension;
    We are their parents and original.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.
    Why should Lady Who Runs the World cross her Who Does This Guy Think He Is?
    I do but beg a little changeling boy
    To be my henchman.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Set your heart at rest;
    The fairy land buys not the child of me.
    His mother was a vot'ress of my order;
    And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
    Full often hath she gossip'd by my side;
    And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
    Marking th' embarked traders on the flood;
    When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,
    And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
    Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
    Following- her womb then rich with my young squire-
    Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
    To fetch me trifles, and return again,
    As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
    But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
    And for her sake do I rear up her boy;
    And for her sake I will not part with him.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. How long within this wood intend you stay?
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Perchance till after This Important Dude' wedding-day.
    If you will patiently dance in our round,
    And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
    If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.
    We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
                                     Exit LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD with her train
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Well, go thy way; thou shalt not from this grove
    Till I torment thee for this injury.
    My gentle Funny Person, come hither. Thou rememb'rest
    Since once I sat upon a promontory,
    And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
    Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
    That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
    And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
    To hear the sea-maid's music.
  FUNNY PERSON. I remember.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
    Flying between the cold moon and the earth
    Cupid, all arm'd; a certain aim he took
    At a fair vestal, throned by the west,
    And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
    As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
    But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
    Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon;
    And the imperial vot'ress passed on,
    In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
    Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
    It fell upon a little western flower,
    Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
    And maidens call it Love-in-idleness.
    Fetch me that flow'r, the herb I showed thee once.
    The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
    Will make or man or woman madly dote
    Upon the next live creature that it sees.
    Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
    Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
  FUNNY PERSON. I'll put a girdle round about the earth
    In forty minutes.                                  Exit FUNNY PERSON
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Having once this juice,
    I'll watch Lady Who Runs the World when she is asleep,
    And drop the liquor of it in her eyes;
    The next thing then she waking looks upon,
    Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
    On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
    She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
    And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
    As I can take it with another herb,
    I'll make her render up her page to me.
    But who comes here? I am invisible;
    And I will overhear their conference.

               Enter THIS GUY, ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG following him

  THIS GUY. I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
    Where is That Guy and fair Lady Done Major Wrong?
    The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
    Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood,
    And here am I, and wood within this wood,
    Because I cannot meet my Lady Done Major Wrong.
    Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
    But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
    Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,
    And I shall have no power to follow you.
  THIS GUY. Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
    Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
    Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. And even for that do I love you the more.
    I am your spaniel; and, This Guy,
    The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
    Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
    Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
    Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
    What worser place can I beg in your love,
    And yet a place of high respect with me,
    Than to be used as you use your dog?
  THIS GUY. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
    For I am sick when I do look on thee.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. And I am sick when I look not on you.
  THIS GUY. You do impeach your modesty too much
    To leave the city and commit yourself
    Into the hands of one that loves you not;
    To trust the opportunity of night,
    And the ill counsel of a desert place,
    With the rich worth of your virginity.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Your virtue is my privilege for that:
    It is not night when I do see your face,
    Therefore I think I am not in the night;
    Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
    For you, in my respect, are all the world.
    Then how can it be said I am alone
    When all the world is here to look on me?
  THIS GUY. I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
    And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
    Run when you will; the story shall be chang'd:
    Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
    The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
    Makes speed to catch the tiger- bootless speed,
    When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
  THIS GUY. I will not stay thy questions; let me go;
    Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
    But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
    You do me mischief. Fie, This Guy!
    Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
    We cannot fight for love as men may do;
    We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
                                                  Exit THIS GUY
    I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
    To die upon the hand I love so well.             Exit ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Fare thee well, nymph; ere he do leave this grove,
    Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.

                            Re-enter FUNNY PERSON

    Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
  FUNNY PERSON. Ay, there it is.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. I pray thee give it me.
    I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
    Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
    Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
    With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine;
    There sleeps Lady Who Runs the World sometime of the night,
    Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
    And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
    Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in;
    And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
    And make her full of hateful fantasies.
    Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
    A sweet Athenian lady is in love
    With a disdainful youth; anoint his eyes;
    But do it when the next thing he espies
    May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man
    By the Athenian garments he hath on.
    Effect it with some care, that he may prove
    More fond on her than she upon her love.
    And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
  FUNNY PERSON. Fear not, my lord; your servant shall do so.      Exeunt




SCENE II.
Another part of the wood

Enter LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD, with her train

  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Come now, a roundel and a fairy song;
    Then, for the third part of a minute, hence:
    Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
    Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
    To make my small elves coats; and some keep back
    The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
    At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
    Then to your offices, and let me rest.

                          The FAIRIES Sing

  FIRST FAIRY. You spotted snakes with double tongue,
               Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
               Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
               Come not near our fairy Queen.
  CHORUS.      Philomel with melody
               Sing in our sweet lullaby.
               Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.
               Never harm
               Nor spell nor charm
               Come our lovely lady nigh.
               So good night, with lullaby.
  SECOND FAIRY.  Weaving spiders, come not here;
                 Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence.
                 Beetles black, approach not near;
                 Worm nor snail do no offence.
  CHORUS.      Philomel with melody, etc.       [LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD Sleeps]
  FIRST FAIRY. Hence away; now all is well.
               One aloof stand sentinel.          Exeunt FAIRIES

      Enter WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS and squeezes the flower on LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD'S eyelids

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. What thou seest when thou dost wake,
    Do it for thy true-love take;
    Love and languish for his sake.
    Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
    Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
    In thy eye that shall appear
    When thou wak'st, it is thy dear.
    Wake when some vile thing is near.                      Exit

                     Enter THAT GUY and LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  THAT GUY. Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood;
    And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
    We'll rest us, Lady Done Major Wrong, if you think it good,
    And tarry for the comfort of the day.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Be it so, That Guy: find you out a bed,
    For I upon this bank will rest my head.
  THAT GUY. One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
    One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Nay, good That Guy; for my sake, my dear,
    Lie further off yet; do not lie so near.
  THAT GUY. O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
    Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
    I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,
    So that but one heart we can make of it;
    Two bosoms interchained with an oath,
    So then two bosoms and a single troth.
    Then by your side no bed-room me deny,
    For lying so, Lady Done Major Wrong, I do not lie.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. That Guy riddles very prettily.
    Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
    If Lady Done Major Wrong meant to say That Guy lied!
    But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
    Lie further off, in human modesty;
    Such separation as may well be said
    Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
    So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend.
    Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
  THAT GUY. Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;
    And then end life when I end loyalty!
    Here is my bed; sleep give thee all his rest!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
                                                    [They sleep]

                          Enter FUNNY PERSON

  FUNNY PERSON.      Through the forest have I gone,
             But Athenian found I none
             On whose eyes I might approve
             This flower's force in stirring love.
             Night and silence- Who is here?
             Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
             This is he, my master said,
             Despised the Athenian maid;
             And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
             On the dank and dirty ground.
             Pretty soul! she durst not lie
             Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
             Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
             All the power this charm doth owe:
             When thou wak'st let love forbid
             Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.
             So awake when I am gone;
             For I must now to Who Does This Guy Think He Is.                      Exit

               Enter THIS GUY and ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG, running

  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Stay, though thou kill me, sweet This Guy.
  THIS GUY. I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.
  THIS GUY. Stay on thy peril; I alone will go.            Exit
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
    The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
    Happy is Lady Done Major Wrong, wheresoe'er she lies,
    For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
    How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears;
    If so, my eyes are oft'ner wash'd than hers.
    No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,
    For beasts that meet me run away for fear;
    Therefore no marvel though This Guy
    Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
    What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
    Made me compare with Lady Done Major Wrong's sphery eyne?
    But who is here? That Guy! on the ground!
    Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
    That Guy, if you live, good sir, awake.
  THAT GUY. [Waking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet
sake.
    Transparent Also Lady Done Major Wrong! Nature shows art,
    That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
    Where is This Guy? O, how fit a word
    Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Do not say so, That Guy; say not so.
    What though he love your Lady Done Major Wrong? Lord, what though?
    Yet Lady Done Major Wrong still loves you; then be content.
  THAT GUY. Content with Lady Done Major Wrong! No: I do repent
    The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
    Not Lady Done Major Wrong but Also Lady Done Major Wrong I love:
    Who will not change a raven for a dove?
    The will of man is by his reason sway'd,
    And reason says you are the worthier maid.
    Things growing are not ripe until their season;
    So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
    And touching now the point of human skill,
    Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
    And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
    Love's stories, written in Love's richest book.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
    When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
    Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
    That I did never, no, nor never can,
    Deserve a sweet look from This Guy' eye,
    But you must flout my insufficiency?
    Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
    In such disdainful manner me to woo.
    But fare you well; perforce I must confess
    I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
    O, that a lady of one man refus'd
    Should of another therefore be abus'd!                  Exit
  THAT GUY. She sees not Lady Done Major Wrong. Lady Done Major Wrong, sleep thou there;
    And never mayst thou come That Guy near!
    For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things
    The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
    Or as the heresies that men do leave
    Are hated most of those they did deceive,
    So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
    Of all be hated, but the most of me!
    And, all my powers, address your love and might
    To honour Helen, and to be her knight!                  Exit
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. [Starting] Help me, That Guy, help me; do thy best
    To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.
    Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!
    That Guy, look how I do quake with fear.
    Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
    And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
    That Guy! What, remov'd? That Guy! lord!
    What, out of hearing gone? No sound, no word?
    Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
    Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
    No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.
    Either death or you I'll find immediately.              Exit

ACT III. SCENE I.
The wood. LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD lying asleep

Enter SUPERSTAR, ANOTHER SUPERSTAR, FAMOUS ACTOR, DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE, NOT REALLY INTO IT, and ALONG FOR THE RIDE

  FAMOUS ACTOR. Are we all met?
  SUPERSTAR. Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for
our
    rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn
    brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we
will
    do it before the Duke.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Peter Superstar!
  SUPERSTAR. What sayest thou, bully Famous Actor?
  FAMOUS ACTOR. There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby
that
    will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill
    himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
  NOT REALLY INTO IT. By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
  ALONG FOR THE RIDE. I believe we must leave the killing out, when all
is
    done.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Not a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me
a
    prologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
    with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed; and
for
    the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not
    Pyramus but Famous Actor the weaver. This will put them out of
fear.
  SUPERSTAR. Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
written
    in eight and six.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and
eight.
  NOT REALLY INTO IT. Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
  ALONG FOR THE RIDE. I fear it, I promise you.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring
in-
    God shield us!- a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing;
for
    there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living;
and
    we ought to look to't.
  NOT REALLY INTO IT. Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be
seen
    through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through,
    saying thus, or to the same defect: 'Ladies,' or 'Fair
ladies, I
    would wish you' or 'I would request you' or 'I would entreat
you
    not to fear, not to tremble. My life for yours! If you think
I
    come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no
such
    thing; I am a man as other men are.' And there, indeed, let
him
    name his name, and tell them plainly he is Another Superstar the joiner.
  SUPERSTAR. Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things-
that
    is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know,
Pyramus
    and Thisby meet by moonlight.
  NOT REALLY INTO IT. Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
  FAMOUS ACTOR. A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out
    moonshine, find out moonshine.
  SUPERSTAR. Yes, it doth shine that night.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber
    window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the
    casement.
  SUPERSTAR. Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and
a
    lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the
person
    of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a
wall in
    the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story,
did
    talk through the chink of a wall.
  NOT REALLY INTO IT. You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Famous Actor?
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have
some
    plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to
signify
    wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that
cranny
    shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
  SUPERSTAR. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every
    mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin;
when
    you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so
every
    one according to his cue.

                          Enter FUNNY PERSON behind

  FUNNY PERSON. What hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here,
    So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?
    What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
    An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
  SUPERSTAR. Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet-
  SUPERSTAR. 'Odious'- odorous!
  FAMOUS ACTOR. -odours savours sweet;
    So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
    But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,
    And by and by I will to thee appear.                    Exit
  FUNNY PERSON. A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here!           Exit
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. Must I speak now?
  SUPERSTAR. Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
but to
    see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
    Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
    Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,

  FAMOUS ACTOR. [Sings]

            And dares not answer nay-
    for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
    Who would give a bird the he, though he cry 'cuckoo' never
so?
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
    Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note;
    So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
    And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,
    On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for
that.
    And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little
company
    together now-a-days. The more the pity that some honest
    neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon
    occasion.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of
this
    wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Out of this wood do not desire to go;
    Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.
    I am a spirit of no common rate;
    The summer still doth tend upon my state;
    And I do love thee; therefore, go with me.
    I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
    And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
    And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
    And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
    That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

    And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,
    And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
    To have my love to bed and to arise;

SCENE II.
Another part of the wood

Enter WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. I wonder if Lady Who Runs the World be awak'd;
    Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
    Which she must dote on in extremity.

                          Enter FUNNY PERSON

    Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit!
    What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
  FUNNY PERSON. My mistress with a monster is in love.
    Near to her close and consecrated bower,
    While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
    A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
    That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
    Were met together to rehearse a play
    Intended for great This Important Dude' nuptial day.
    The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort,
    Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
    Forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake;
    When I did him at this advantage take,
    An ass's nole I fixed on his head.
    Anon his Thisby must be answered,
    And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
    As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
    Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
    Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
    Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
    So at his sight away his fellows fly;
    And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;
    He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.
    Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
    Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,
    For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
    Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
    I led them on in this distracted fear,
    And left sweet Pyramus translated there;
    When in that moment, so it came to pass,
    Lady Who Runs the World wak'd, and straightway lov'd an ass.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. This falls out better than I could devise.
    But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
    With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
  FUNNY PERSON. I took him sleeping- that is finish'd too-
    And the Athenian woman by his side;
    That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd.

                 Enter THIS GUY and LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
  FUNNY PERSON. This is the woman, but not this the man.
  THIS GUY. O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
    Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,
    For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
    If thou hast slain That Guy in his sleep,
    Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
    And kill me too.
    The sun was not so true unto the day
    As he to me. Would he have stolen away
    From sleeping Lady Done Major Wrong? I'll believe as soon
    This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon
    May through the centre creep and so displease
    Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes.
    It cannot be but thou hast murd'red him;
    So should a murderer look- so dead, so grim.
  THIS GUY. So should the murdered look; and so should I,
    Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty;
    Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
    As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. What's this to my That Guy? Where is he?
    Ah, good This Guy, wilt thou give him me?
  THIS GUY. I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds
    Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
    Henceforth be never numb'red among men!
    O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!
    Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
    And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
    Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
    An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
    Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
  THIS GUY. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
    I am not guilty of That Guy's blood;
    Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
  THIS GUY. An if I could, what should I get therefore?
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. A privilege never to see me more.
    And from thy hated presence part I so;
    See me no more whether he be dead or no.                Exit
  THIS GUY. There is no following her in this fierce vein;
    Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.
    So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
    For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
    Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
    If for his tender here I make some stay.         [Lies down]
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,
    And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.
    Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
    Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
  FUNNY PERSON. Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
    A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. About the wood go swifter than the wind,
    And Also Lady Done Major Wrong of Athens look thou find;
    All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
    With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.
    By some illusion see thou bring her here;
    I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
  FUNNY PERSON. I go, I go; look how I go,
    Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.               Exit
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS.       Flower of this purple dye,
                Hit with Cupid's archery,
                Sink in apple of his eye.
                When his love he doth espy,
                Let her shine as gloriously
                As the Venus of the sky.
                When thou wak'st, if she be by,
                Beg of her for remedy.

  FUNNY PERSON.         Captain of our fairy band,
                Also Lady Done Major Wrong is here at hand,
                And the youth mistook by me
                Pleading for a lover's fee;
                Shall we their fond pageant see?
                Lord, what fools these mortals be!
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS.       Stand aside. The noise they make
                Will cause This Guy to awake.
  FUNNY PERSON.         Then will two at once woo one.
                That must needs be sport alone;
                And those things do best please me
                That befall prepost'rously.

                   Enter THAT GUY and ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  THAT GUY. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
    Scorn and derision never come in tears.
    Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
    In their nativity all truth appears.
    How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
    Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. You do advance your cunning more and more.
    When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
    These vows are Lady Done Major Wrong's. Will you give her o'er?
    Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
    Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
    Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.
  THAT GUY. I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
  THAT GUY. This Guy loves her, and he loves not you.
  THIS GUY. [Awaking] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
    To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
    Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
    Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
    That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,
    Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
    When thou hold'st up thy hand. O, let me kiss
    This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
    To set against me for your merriment.
    If you were civil and knew courtesy,
    You would not do me thus much injury.
    Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
    But you must join in souls to mock me too?
    If you were men, as men you are in show,
    You would not use a gentle lady so:
    To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
    When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
    You both are rivals, and love Lady Done Major Wrong;
    And now both rivals, to mock Also Lady Done Major Wrong.
    A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
    To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
    With your derision! None of noble sort
    Would so offend a virgin, and extort
    A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
  THAT GUY. You are unkind, This Guy; be not so;
    For you love Lady Done Major Wrong. This you know I know;
    And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
    In Lady Done Major Wrong's love I yield you up my part;
    And yours of Also Lady Done Major Wrong to me bequeath,
    Whom I do love and will do till my death.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  THIS GUY. That Guy, keep thy Lady Done Major Wrong; I will none.
    If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
    My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
    And now to Helen is it home return'd,
    There to remain.
  THAT GUY. Helen, it is not so.
  THIS GUY. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
    Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
    Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.

                       Enter LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
    The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
    Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
    It pays the hearing double recompense.
    Thou art not by mine eye, That Guy, found;
    Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
    But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
  THAT GUY. Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. What love could press That Guy from my side?
  THAT GUY. That Guy's love, that would not let him bide-
    Fair Also Lady Done Major Wrong, who more engilds the night
    Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
    Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know
    The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
    Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
    To fashion this false sport in spite of me.
    Injurious Lady Done Major Wrong! most ungrateful maid!
    Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd,
    To bait me with this foul derision?
    Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,
    The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
    When we have chid the hasty-footed time
    For parting us- O, is all forgot?
    All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
    We, Lady Done Major Wrong, like two artificial gods,
    Have with our needles created both one flower,
    Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
    Both warbling of one song, both in one key;
    As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,
    Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
    Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
    But yet an union in partition,
    Two lovely berries moulded on one stern;
    So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
    Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
    Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
    And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
    To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
    It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly;
    Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
    Though I alone do feel the injury.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I am amazed at your passionate words;
    I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Have you not set That Guy, as in scorn,
    To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
    And made your other love, This Guy,
    Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
    To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
    Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
    To her he hates? And wherefore doth That Guy
    Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
    And tender me, forsooth, affection,
    But by your setting on, by your consent?
    What though I be not so in grace as you,
    So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
    But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
    This you should pity rather than despise.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I understand not what you mean by this.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad looks,
    Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,
    Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up;
    This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
    If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
    You would not make me such an argument.
    But fare ye well; 'tis partly my own fault,
    Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.
  THAT GUY. Stay, gentle Also Lady Done Major Wrong; hear my excuse;
    My love, my life, my soul, fair Also Lady Done Major Wrong!
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O excellent!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Sweet, do not scorn her so.
  THIS GUY. If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
  THAT GUY. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
    Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
    Helen, I love thee, by my life I do;
    I swear by that which I will lose for thee
    To prove him false that says I love thee not.
  THIS GUY. I say I love thee more than he can do.
  THAT GUY. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
  THIS GUY. Quick, come.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. That Guy, whereto tends all this?
  THAT GUY. Away, you Ethiope!
  THIS GUY. No, no, he will
    Seem to break loose- take on as you would follow,
    But yet come not. You are a tame man; go!
  THAT GUY. Hang off, thou cat, thou burr; vile thing, let loose,
    Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
    Sweet love?
  THAT GUY. Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out!
    Out, loathed med'cine! O hated potion, hence!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Do you not jest?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Yes, sooth; and so do you.
  THAT GUY. This Guy, I will keep my word with thee.
  THIS GUY. I would I had your bond; for I perceive
    A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
  THAT GUY. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
    Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
    Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?
    Am not I Lady Done Major Wrong? Are not you That Guy?
    I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
    Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me.
    Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!-
    In earnest, shall I say?
  THAT GUY. Ay, by my life!
    And never did desire to see thee more.
    Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
    Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
    That I do hate thee and love Also Lady Done Major Wrong.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
    You thief of love! What! Have you come by night,
    And stol'n my love's heart from him?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Fine, i' faith!
    Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
    No touch of bashfulness? What! Will you tear
    Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
    Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet you!
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. 'Puppet!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
    Now I perceive that she hath made compare
    Between our statures; she hath urg'd her height;
    And with her personage, her tall personage,
    Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
    And are you grown so high in his esteem
    Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
    How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak.
    How low am I? I am not yet so low
    But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
    Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;
    I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
    I am a right maid for my cowardice;
    Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
    Because she is something lower than myself,
    That I can match her.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. 'Lower' hark, again.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Good Lady Done Major Wrong, do not be so bitter with me.
    I evermore did love you, Lady Done Major Wrong,
    Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
    Save that, in love unto This Guy,
    I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
    He followed you; for love I followed him;
    But he hath chid me hence, and threat'ned me
    To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too;
    And now, so you will let me quiet go,
    To Athens will I bear my folly back,
    And follow you no further. Let me go.
    You see how simple and how fond I am.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. What! with That Guy?
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. With This Guy.
  THAT GUY. Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Also Lady Done Major Wrong.
  THIS GUY. No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd;
    She was a vixen when she went to school;
    And, though she be but little, she is fierce.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. 'Little' again! Nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
    Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
    Let me come to her.
  THAT GUY. Get you gone, you dwarf;
    You minimus, of hind'ring knot-grass made;
    You bead, you acorn.
  THIS GUY. You are too officious
    In her behalf that scorns your services.
    Let her alone; speak not of Also Lady Done Major Wrong;
    Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
    Never so little show of love to her,
    Thou shalt aby it.
  THAT GUY. Now she holds me not.
    Now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right,
    Of thine or mine, is most in Also Lady Done Major Wrong.
  THIS GUY. Follow! Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
                                   Exeunt THAT GUY and THIS GUY
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
    Nay, go not back.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I will not trust you, I;
    Nor longer stay in your curst company.
    Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
    My legs are longer though, to run away.                 Exit
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. I am amaz'd, and know not what to say.            Exit
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak'st,
    Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
  FUNNY PERSON. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
    Did not you tell me I should know the man
    By the Athenian garments he had on?
    And so far blameless proves my enterprise
    That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
    And so far am I glad it so did sort,
    As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
    Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
    The starry welkin cover thou anon
    With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
    And lead these testy rivals so astray
    As one come not within another's way.
    Like to That Guy sometime frame thy tongue,
    Then stir This Guy up with bitter wrong;
    And sometime rail thou like This Guy;
    And from each other look thou lead them thus,
    Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
    With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
    Then crush this herb into That Guy's eye;
    Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
    To take from thence all error with his might
    And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
    When they next wake, all this derision
    Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
    And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
    With league whose date till death shall never end.
    Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
    I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;
    And then I will her charmed eye release
    From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
  FUNNY PERSON. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
    For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;
    And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger,
    At whose approach ghosts, wand'ring here and there,
    Troop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all
    That in cross-ways and floods have burial,
    Already to their wormy beds are gone,
    For fear lest day should look their shames upon;
    They wilfully themselves exil'd from light,
    And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. But we are spirits of another sort:
    I with the Morning's love have oft made sport;
    And, like a forester, the groves may tread
    Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,
    Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
    Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
    But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay;
    We may effect this business yet ere day.         Exit WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS
  FUNNY PERSON.      Up and down, up and down,
             I will lead them up and down.
             I am fear'd in field and town.
             Goblin, lead them up and down.
    Here comes one.

                      Enter THAT GUY

  THAT GUY. Where art thou, proud This Guy? Speak thou now.
  FUNNY PERSON. Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?
  THAT GUY. I will be with thee straight.
  FUNNY PERSON. Follow me, then,
    To plainer ground.      Exit THAT GUY as following the voice

                      Enter THIS GUY

  THIS GUY. That Guy, speak again.
    Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
    Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
  FUNNY PERSON. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
    Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
    And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child;
    I'll whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd
    That draws a sword on thee.
  THIS GUY. Yea, art thou there?
  FUNNY PERSON. Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.       Exeunt

                      Re-enter THAT GUY

  THAT GUY. He goes before me, and still dares me on;
    When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
    The villain is much lighter heel'd than I.
    I followed fast, but faster he did fly,
    That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
    And here will rest me. [Lies down] Come, thou gentle day.
    For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
    I'll find This Guy, and revenge this spite.        [Sleeps]

                 Re-enter FUNNY PERSON and THIS GUY

  FUNNY PERSON. Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not?
  THIS GUY. Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot
    Thou run'st before me, shifting every place,
    And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face.
    Where art thou now?
  FUNNY PERSON. Come hither; I am here.
  THIS GUY. Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this
dear,
    If ever I thy face by daylight see;
    Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
    To measure out my length on this cold bed.
    By day's approach look to be visited.
                                          [Lies down and sleeps]

                       Enter ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. O weary night, O long and tedious night,
    Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,
    That I may back to Athens by daylight,
    From these that my poor company detest.
    And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
    Steal me awhile from mine own company.              [Sleeps]
  FUNNY PERSON.       Yet but three? Come one more;
              Two of both kinds makes up four.
              Here she comes, curst and sad.
              Cupid is a knavish lad,
              Thus to make poor females mad.

                     Enter LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Never so weary, never so in woe,
    Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers,
    I can no further crawl, no further go;
    My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
    Here will I rest me till the break of day.
    Heavens shield That Guy, if they mean a fray!
                                          [Lies down and sleeps]
  FUNNY PERSON.          On the ground
                 Sleep sound;
                 I'll apply
                 To your eye,
          Gentle lover, remedy.
                        [Squeezing the juice on THAT GUY'S eyes]
                 When thou wak'st,
                 Thou tak'st
                 True delight
                 In the sight
          Of thy former lady's eye;
          And the country proverb known,
          That every man should take his own,
          In your waking shall be shown:
                 Jack shall have Jill;
                 Nought shall go ill;
    The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

ACT IV. SCENE I.
The wood. THAT GUY, THIS GUY, ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG, and LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG, lying asleep

Enter LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD and Famous Actor; WHAT A GREAT NAME, RLY, SRSLY,
CAN'T HATE ON THIS ONE,
and other FAIRIES attending;
                      WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS behind, unseen

  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Come, sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed,
    While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
    And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
    And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Where's What a Great Name?
  WHAT A GREAT NAME. Ready.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Scratch my head, What a Great Name.
    Where's Mounsieur Rly?
  RLY. Ready.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Mounsieur Rly; good mounsieur, get you your weapons
in
    your hand and kill me a red-hipp'd humble-bee on the top of a
    thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not
fret
    yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and, good
mounsieur,
    have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have
you
    overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur
    Can't Hate on this One?
  CAN'T HATE ON THIS ONE. Ready.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Can't Hate on this One. Pray you,
leave
    your curtsy, good mounsieur.
  CAN'T HATE ON THIS ONE. What's your will?
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Rly to
    scratch. I must to the barber's, mounsieur; for methinks I am
    marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass,
if
    my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
  FAMOUS ACTOR. I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the
tongs
    and the bones.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry
    oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay. Good
    hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
    The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But,
I
    pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an
exposition
    of sleep come upon me.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
    Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.       Exeunt FAIRIES
    So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
    Gently entwist; the female ivy so
    Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
    O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!         [They sleep]

                         Enter FUNNY PERSON

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. [Advancing] Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet
      sight?
    Her dotage now I do begin to pity;
    For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
    Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,
    I did upbraid her and fall out with her.
    For she his hairy temples then had rounded
    With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
    And that same dew which sometime on the buds
    Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
    Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes,
    Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
    When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
    And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
    I then did ask of her her changeling child;
    Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
    To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
    And now I have the boy, I will undo
    This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
    And, gentle Funny Person, take this transformed scalp
    From off the head of this Athenian swain,
    That he awaking when the other do
    May all to Athens back again repair,
    And think no more of this night's accidents
    But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
    But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
                                             [Touching her eyes]
           Be as thou wast wont to be;
           See as thou was wont to see.
           Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
           Hath such force and blessed power.
    Now, my Lady Who Runs the World; wake you, my sweet queen.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. My Who Does This Guy Think He Is! What visions have I seen!
    Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. There lies your love.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. How came these things to pass?
    O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
    Lady Who Runs the World, music call; and strike more dead
    Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD. Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep!
  FUNNY PERSON. Now when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS. Sound, music. Come, my Queen, take hands with me,
                                                         [Music]
    And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
    Now thou and I are new in amity,
    And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
    Dance in Duke This Important Dude' house triumphantly,
    And bless it to all fair prosperity.
    There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
    Wedded, with This Important Dude, an in jollity.
  FUNNY PERSON.       Fairy King, attend and mark;
              I do hear the morning lark.
  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS.     Then, my Queen, in silence sad,
              Trip we after night's shade.
              We the globe can compass soon,
              Swifter than the wand'ring moon.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD.    Come, my lord; and in our flight,
              Tell me how it came this night
              That I sleeping here was found
              With these mortals on the ground.           Exeunt

        To the winding of horns, enter THIS IMPORTANT DUDE, PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE,
                      NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE, and train

  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Go, one of you, find out the forester;
    For now our observation is perform'd,
    And since we have the vaward of the day,
    My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
    Uncouple in the western valley; let them go.
    Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.    Exit an ATTENDANT
    We will, fair Queen, up to the mountain's top,
    And mark the musical confusion
    Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
    When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
    With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear
    Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,
    The skies, the fountains, every region near
    Seem'd all one mutual cry. I never heard
    So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
    So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung
    With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
    Crook-knee'd and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
    Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
    Each under each. A cry more tuneable
    Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
    In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.
    Judge when you hear. But, soft, what nymphs are these?
  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
    And this That Guy, this This Guy is,
    This Also Lady Done Major Wrong, old Nedar's Also Lady Done Major Wrong.
    I wonder of their being here together.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. No doubt they rose up early to observe
    The rite of May; and, hearing our intent,
    Came here in grace of our solemnity.
    But speak, Not So Important Dude; is not this the day
    That Lady Done Major Wrong should give answer of her choice?
  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. It is, my lord.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
                           [Horns and shout within. The sleepers
                                     awake and kneel to THIS IMPORTANT DUDE]
    Good-morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past;
    Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
  THAT GUY. Pardon, my lord.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. I pray you all, stand up.
    I know you two are rival enemies;
    How comes this gentle concord in the world
    That hatred is so far from jealousy
    To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
  THAT GUY. My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
    Half sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,
    I cannot truly say how I came here,
    But, as I think- for truly would I speak,
    And now I do bethink me, so it is-
    I came with Lady Done Major Wrong hither. Our intent
    Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
    Without the peril of the Athenian law-
  NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE. Enough, enough, my Lord; you have enough;
    I beg the law, the law upon his head.
    They would have stol'n away, they would, This Guy,
    Thereby to have defeated you and me:
    You of your wife, and me of my consent,
    Of my consent that she should be your wife.
  THIS GUY. My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
    Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
    And I in fury hither followed them,
    Fair Also Lady Done Major Wrong in fancy following me.
    But, my good lord, I wot not by what power-
    But by some power it is- my love to Lady Done Major Wrong,
    Melted as the snow, seems to me now
    As the remembrance of an idle gaud
    Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
    And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
    The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
    Is only Also Lady Done Major Wrong. To her, my lord,
    Was I betroth'd ere I saw Lady Done Major Wrong.
    But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
    But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
    Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
    And will for evermore be true to it.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;
    Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
    Not So Important Dude, I will overbear your will;
    For in the temple, by and by, with us
    These couples shall eternally be knit.
    And, for the morning now is something worn,
    Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
    Away with us to Athens, three and three;
    We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
    Come, Probably Cooler than Important Dude.
                     Exeunt THIS IMPORTANT DUDE, PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE, NOT SO IMPORTANT DUDE, and train
  THIS GUY. These things seem small and undistinguishable,
    Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
    When every thing seems double.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. So methinks;
    And I have found This Guy like a jewel,
    Mine own, and not mine own.
  THIS GUY. Are you sure
    That we are awake? It seems to me
    That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
    The Duke was here, and bid us follow him?
  LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. Yea, and my father.
  ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG. And Probably Cooler than Important Dude.
  THAT GUY. And he did bid us follow to the temple.
  THIS GUY. Why, then, we are awake; let's follow him;
    And by the way let us recount our dreams.             Exeunt
  FAMOUS ACTOR. [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will
answer. My
    next is 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! Peter Superstar! Don't Sleep on This One,
the
    bellows-mender! Not Really Into It, the tinker! Along for the Ride! God's my life,
    stol'n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
vision.
    I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it
was.
    Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream.
Methought
    I was- there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and
    methought I had, but man is but a patch'd fool, if he will
offer
    to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard,
the
    ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste,
his
    tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
was. I
    will get Peter Superstar to write a ballad of this dream. It
shall
    be call'd 'Famous Actor's Dream,' because it hath no bottom; and I
will
    sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke.
    Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it
at
    her death.                                              Exit




SCENE II.
Athens. SUPERSTAR'S house

Enter SUPERSTAR, DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE, NOT REALLY INTO IT, and ALONG FOR THE RIDE

  SUPERSTAR. Have you sent to Famous Actor's house? Is he come home yet?
  ALONG FOR THE RIDE. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
transported.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. If he come not, then the play is marr'd; it goes not
    forward, doth it?
  SUPERSTAR. It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens
able
    to discharge Pyramus but he.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
    Athens.
  SUPERSTAR. Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour
for
    a sweet voice.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. You must say 'paragon.' A paramour is- God bless us!- A
    thing of naught.

                           Enter ANOTHER SUPERSTAR

  ANOTHER SUPERSTAR. Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple; and there is
two
    or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone

    forward, we had all been made men.
  DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ONE. O sweet bully Famous Actor! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
    during his life; he could not have scaped sixpence a day. An
the
    Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus,
I'll
    be hanged. He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
Pyramus,
    or nothing.

                           Enter FAMOUS ACTOR

  FAMOUS ACTOR. Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?
  SUPERSTAR. Famous Actor! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not
what;
    for if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you
    everything, right as it fell out.
  SUPERSTAR. Let us hear, sweet Famous Actor.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the
    Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together; good strings to
your
    beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the
palace;
    every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is,
our
    play is preferr'd. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen;
and
    let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they
shall
    hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no
    onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do
not
    doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more
words.
    Away, go, away!                                       Exeunt

ACT V. SCENE I.
Athens. The palace of THIS IMPORTANT DUDE

Enter THIS IMPORTANT DUDE, PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE, ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE, LORDS, and ATTENDANTS

  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. 'Tis strange, my This Important Dude, that these lovers speak
of.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. More strange than true. I never may believe
    These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
    Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
    Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
    More than cool reason ever comprehends.
    The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,
    Are of imagination all compact.
    One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
    That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,
    Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.
    The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
    Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
    And as imagination bodies forth
    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
    Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
    A local habitation and a name.
    Such tricks hath strong imagination
    That, if it would but apprehend some joy,
    It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
    Or in the night, imagining some fear,
    How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear?
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. But all the story of the night told over,
    And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
    More witnesseth than fancy's images,
    And grows to something of great constancy,
    But howsoever strange and admirable.

          Enter THAT GUY, THIS GUY, LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG, and ALSO LADY DONE MAJOR WRONG

  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
    Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love
    Accompany your hearts!
  THAT GUY. More than to us
    Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
    To wear away this long age of three hours
    Between our after-supper and bed-time?
    Where is our usual manager of mirth?
    What revels are in hand? Is there no play
    To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
    Call On Stage for Like a Minute.
  ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE. Here, mighty This Important Dude.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?
    What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
    The lazy time, if not with some delight?
  ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE. There is a brief how many sports are ripe;
    Make choice of which your Highness will see first.
                                                [Giving a paper]
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
    By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
    We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
    In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
    'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
    Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
    That is an old device, and it was play'd
    When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
    'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
    Of Learning, late deceas'd in beggary.'
    That is some satire, keen and critical,
    Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
    'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
    And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.'
    Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
    That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
    How shall we find the concord of this discord?
  ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE. A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
    Which is as brief as I have known a play;
    But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
    Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
    There is not one word apt, one player fitted.
    And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
    For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
    Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess,
    Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
    The passion of loud laughter never shed.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. What are they that do play it?
  ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE. Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
    Which never labour'd in their minds till now;
    And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
    With this same play against your nuptial.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. And we will hear it.
  ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE. No, my noble lord,
    It is not for you. I have heard it over,
    And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
    Unless you can find sport in their intents,
    Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
    To do you service.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. I will hear that play;
    For never anything can be amiss
    When simpleness and duty tender it.
    Go, bring them in; and take your places, ladies.
                                                Exit ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
    And duty in his service perishing.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. He says they can do nothing in this kind.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

  ON STAGE FOR LIKE A MINUTE. SO please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Let him approach.              [Flourish of trumpets]

                 Enter SUPERSTAR as the PROLOGUE

  PROLOGUE. If we offend, it is with our good will.
    That you should think, we come not to offend,
    But with good will. To show our simple skill,
    That is the true beginning of our end.
    Consider then, we come but in despite.
    We do not come, as minding to content you,
    Our true intent is. All for your delight
    We are not here. That you should here repent you,
    The actors are at band; and, by their show,
    You shall know all, that you are like to know,
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. This fellow doth not stand upon points.
  THAT GUY. He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
not
    the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak,
but
    to speak true.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child
on a
    recorder- a sound, but not in government.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im
paired,
    but all disordered. Who is next?

          Enter, with a trumpet before them, as in dumb show,
            PYRAMUS and THISBY, WALL, MOONSHINE, and LION

  PROLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,
                                             LION, and MOONSHINE
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. I wonder if the lion be to speak.
  THIS GUY. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses
do.
  WALL. In this same interlude it doth befall
    That I, one Not Really Into It by name, present a wall;
    And such a wall as I would have you think
    That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
    Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
    Did whisper often very secretly.
    This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
    That I am that same wall; the truth is so;
    And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
    Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
  THIS GUY. It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
    discourse, my lord.

                       Enter PYRAMUS

  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
  PYRAMUS. O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
    O night, which ever art when day is not!
    O night, O night, alack, alack, alack,
    I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
    And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
    That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
    Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
    Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
                                     [WALL holds up his fingers]
    Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this!
    But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.
    O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,
    Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me!
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse
again.
  PYRAMUS. No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is
Thisby's
    cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the
wall.
    You shall see it will fall pat as I told you; yonder she
comes.

                          Enter THISBY

  THISBY. O wall, full often hast thou beard my moans,
    For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
    My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
    Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
  PYRAMUS. I see a voice; now will I to the chink,
    To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.
    Thisby!
  THISBY. My love! thou art my love, I think.
  PYRAMUS. Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
    And like Limander am I trusty still.
  THISBY. And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
  PYRAMUS. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
  THISBY. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
  PYRAMUS. O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
  THISBY. I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
  PYRAMUS. Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
  THISBY. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
                                       Exeunt PYRAMUS and THISBY
  WALL. Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
    And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.           Exit WALL
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
  THIS GUY. No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
    without warning.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
are
    no worse, if imagination amend them.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves,
    they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts
in, a
    man and a lion.

                   Enter LION and MOONSHINE

  LION. You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
    The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
    May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,
    When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
    Then know that I as Another Superstar the joiner am
    A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
    For, if I should as lion come in strife
    Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
  THIS GUY. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
  THAT GUY. This lion is a very fox for his valour.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. True; and a goose for his discretion.
  THIS GUY. Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
    discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
for
    the goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to his
    discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.
  MOONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
  THIS GUY. He should have worn the horns on his head.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within
the
    circumference.
  MOONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
    Myself the Man i' th' Moon do seem to be.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man
should
    be put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' th' moon?
  THIS GUY. He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
see, it
    is already in snuff.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he
is
    in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must
stay
    the time.
  THAT GUY. Proceed, Moon.
  MOON. All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn
is
    the moon; I, the Man i' th' Moon; this thorn-bush, my
thorn-bush;
    and this dog, my dog.
  THIS GUY. Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all
these
    are in the moon. But silence; here comes Thisby.

                        Re-enter THISBY

  THISBY. This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
  LION. [Roaring] O-                           [THISBY runs off]
  THIS GUY. Well roar'd, Lion.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Well run, Thisby.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good
    grace.            [The LION tears THISBY'S Mantle, and exit]
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Well mous'd, Lion.

                        Re-enter PYRAMUS

  THIS GUY. And then came Pyramus.
  THAT GUY. And so the lion vanish'd.
  PYRAMUS. Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
    I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
    For, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,
    I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
             But stay, O spite!
             But mark, poor knight,
           What dreadful dole is here!
             Eyes, do you see?
             How can it he?
           O dainty duck! O dear!
             Thy mantle good,
             What! stain'd with blood?
           Approach, ye Furies fell.
             O Fates! come, come;
             Cut thread and thrum;
           Quail, crush, conclude, and quell.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go
    near to make a man look sad.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
  PYRAMUS. O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
    Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
    Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame
    That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.
             Come, tears, confound;
             Out, sword, and wound
           The pap of Pyramus;
             Ay, that left pap,
             Where heart doth hop.               [Stabs himself]
           Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
             Now am I dead,
             Now am I fled;
           My soul is in the sky.
             Tongue, lose thy light;
             Moon, take thy flight.             [Exit MOONSHINE]
           Now die, die, die, die, die.                   [Dies]
  THIS GUY. No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
  THAT GUY. Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
yet
    prove an ass.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes
back
    and finds her lover?

                       Re-enter THISBY

  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
her
    passion ends the play.
  PROBABLY COOLER THAN IMPORTANT DUDE. Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
    Pyramus; I hope she will be brief.
  THIS GUY. A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
    Thisby, is the better- he for a man, God warrant us: She for
a
    woman, God bless us!
  THAT GUY. She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
  THIS GUY. And thus she moans, videlicet:-
  THISBY.      Asleep, my love?
               What, dead, my dove?
             O Pyramus, arise,
               Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
               Dead, dead? A tomb
             Must cover thy sweet eyes.
               These lily lips,
               This cherry nose,
             These yellow cowslip cheeks,
               Are gone, are gone;
               Lovers, make moan;
             His eyes were green as leeks.
               O Sisters Three,
               Come, come to me,
             With hands as pale as milk;
               Lay them in gore,
               Since you have shore
             With shears his thread of silk.
               Tongue, not a word.
               Come, trusty sword;
             Come, blade, my breast imbrue.      [Stabs herself]
               And farewell, friends;
               Thus Thisby ends;
             Adieu, adieu, adieu.                         [Dies]
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
  THIS GUY. Ay, and Wall too.
  FAMOUS ACTOR. [Starting up] No, I assure you; the wall is down that
    parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue,
or
    to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?
  THIS IMPORTANT DUDE. No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
excuse.
    Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there need
none
    to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus,
and
    hang'd himself in Thisby's garter, it would have been a fine
    tragedy. And so it is, truly; and very notably discharg'd.
But
    come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.     [A dance]
    The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.
    Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
    I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,
    As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
    This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd
    The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
    A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
    In nightly revels and new jollity.                    Exeunt

                     Enter FUNNY PERSON with a broom

  FUNNY PERSON.      Now the hungry lion roars,
             And the wolf behowls the moon;
             Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
             All with weary task fordone.
             Now the wasted brands do glow,
             Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
             Puts the wretch that lies in woe
             In remembrance of a shroud.
             Now it is the time of night
             That the graves, all gaping wide,
             Every one lets forth his sprite,
             In the church-way paths to glide.
             And we fairies, that do run
             By the triple Hecate's team
             From the presence of the sun,
             Following darkness like a dream,
             Now are frolic. Not a mouse
             Shall disturb this hallowed house.
             I am sent with broom before,
             To sweep the dust behind the door.

         Enter WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS and LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD, with all their train

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS.    Through the house give glimmering light,
             By the dead and drowsy fire;
             Every elf and fairy sprite
             Hop as light as bird from brier;
             And this ditty, after me,
             Sing and dance it trippingly.
  LADY WHO RUNS THE WORLD.      First, rehearse your song by rote,
                To each word a warbling note;
                Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
                Will we sing, and bless this place.

           [WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS leading, the FAIRIES sing and dance]

  WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS.    Now, until the break of day,
             Through this house each fairy stray.
             To the best bride-bed will we,
             Which by us shall blessed be;
             And the issue there create
             Ever shall be fortunate.
             So shall all the couples three
             Ever true in loving be;
             And the blots of Nature's hand
             Shall not in their issue stand;
             Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,
             Nor mark prodigious, such as are
             Despised in nativity,
             Shall upon their children be.
             With this field-dew consecrate,
             Every fairy take his gait,
             And each several chamber bless,
             Through this palace, with sweet peace;
             And the owner of it blest
             Ever shall in safety rest.
             Trip away; make no stay;
             Meet me all by break of day.    Exeunt all but FUNNY PERSON
  FUNNY PERSON.      If we shadows have offended,
             Think but this, and all is mended,
             That you have but slumb'red here
             While these visions did appear.
             And this weak and idle theme,
             No more yielding but a dream,
             Gentles, do not reprehend.
             If you pardon, we will mend.
             And, as I am an honest Funny Person,
             If we have unearned luck
             Now to scape the serpent's tongue,
             We will make amends ere long;
             Else the Funny Person a liar call.
             So, good night unto you all.
             Give me your hands, if we be friends,
             And Robin shall restore amends.                Exit
